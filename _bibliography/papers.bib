abstract={I argue that there is good evidence to think that `Bob wonders whether the door is open' entails that he doesn't already believe that the door is open. This is in tension with a popular position in epistemology, according to which inquiry and wondering settle at some strong epistemic state while belief is weak.},

abstract={According to certain pragmatics model, assertions update the context set and imperatives update the to-do lists of the global context. While there has been a long tradition to posit a localized context set (``the local context''), no attempt has been made to localize the to-do list. We suggest that there is a need to localize local to-do lists, making the local context a pair of local context set and local to-do lists, to explain declaratives-and-imperative conjunctions and disjunctions (e.g, `Don't plagiarize or you'd be caught').},

  title={Restriction in doubly-modal disjunctions},
  author={Bai, Yunhui and Kendrick, Jonathan Caleb},
  note={to appear},
abstract={According to a prominent theory of disjunction, the modal in `John is away, or he must be in his office' has its domain restricted by the negation of the left disjunct `John is away'. However, in `John has to write a paper, or he will get a C', the right modal is not restricted by the negation of the entirety of the left disjunct but instead by the negation of the prejacent of the left disjunct. We dig into the empirical pattern of this flexibility of restriction and propose a new theory of disjunction.},
